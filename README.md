## Overview

The world of data engineering is constantly evolving, with new tools and technologies emerging regularly. Building an effective analytics platform can be challenging, especially if you are unfamiliar with all the available tools. This course, led by Thalia Barrera, guides data professionals through the implementation of an end-to-end data engineering project using modern open-source tools. The course covers best practices in data modeling, testing, documentation, and version control, demonstrating how to efficiently extract, load, and transform data into a unified, analytics-ready format. Through practical examples, Thalia shows how to construct a robust data pipeline for a fictional ecommerce company and implement best practices in data engineering.
